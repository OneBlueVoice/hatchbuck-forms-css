# hatchbuck-forms-css
This project takes all possible form fields from the Hatchbuck CRM and adds custom CSS for popping these forms onto a WordPress page with Graity Forms. 

Essentially, it adds some basic styling to make the form fields look more like standard Gravity Forms fields and not the hot mess that Hathcbuck forms look like unstyled.
